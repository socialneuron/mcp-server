# Changelog

All notable changes to `@socialneuron/mcp-server` will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.15] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- **Public tool surface tightened.** Internal service tools used by Social Neuron's own automation are still registered and scope-gated at runtime, but are no longer advertised on the hosted server card, HTTP discovery, `search_tools`, knowledge documents, or the CLI tool listing. The hosted endpoint now advertises 85 tools; the npm stdio server exposes 87 discoverable tools (including 2 local screen-capture tools).
- **Tool descriptions cleaned up.** Internal project references and implementation jargon removed from tool descriptions across the catalog.
- **`run_content_pipeline` scheduling guard restored.** Scheduling again requires `schedule_confirmed=true` after explicit user approval, cannot run with the quality stage skipped, caps generated posts to the requested plan size, drops posts targeting unrequested platforms, and counts scheduled posts against the credit budget. (This hardening was unintentionally dropped in the 1.7.14 source sync.)
- **Metadata contract unified + CI-guarded.** `server.json` version/pricing/tool-count now match `package.json` and the canonical pricing (MCP requires Pro $49/mo or higher; free tier is 50 credits/mo with no MCP access). Added `mcpName` for MCP Registry ownership verification. New `npm run verify:metadata` gate (wired into CI and release) blocks stale counts, stale pricing, internal codenames, and dead endpoint links from re-entering the public surface.
- **Docs corrected.** REST API docs (tool count, response `version` example, plan limits), troubleshooting boot log line (95/95), integration methods (stdio vs hosted tool split), and auth docs (plan-scope matrix; removed internal implementation notes). Removed links to the not-yet-deployed `/v1/openapi.json` endpoint.
- **SDK release path hardened.** `packages/sdk` now ships a `package-lock.json`, the SDK release workflow uses `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and Dependabot watches `/packages/sdk` and `/apps/content-calendar`.

## [1.7.12–1.7.14] - 2026-06/07

Released without changelog entries (see git history): OAuth connector flow + DCR, MCP Apps content calendar, trial-key scopes and post-trial degrade, funnel instrumentation, 96-tool catalog sync, dependency cooldown pins.

## [1.7.11] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- **Tier listing aligned to Phase 4b canonical pricing.** The `socialneuron://docs/capabilities` resource now exposes the live tier prices: Free $0/mo · Starter $19/mo · Pro $49/mo · Team $99/mo · Agency $249/mo. Versions 1.7.7 → 1.7.10 shipped the stale pre-Phase-4b values ($29/$79/$199 and no Agency tier) to every connected MCP client, including Claude Code / Claude Desktop / Cursor. Upgrading to 1.7.11 closes that gap.
- **MCP access matrix corrected.** Free and Starter are now `mcp_access: 'None'` (string, not boolean), matching the canonical contract that MCP read+analytics starts at Pro and full MCP starts at Team. Previous bundle inconsistently used `false` (boolean) for free/starter and strings for the paid tiers.
- **Agency tier added** with full MCP + REST API + 20 keys + multi-brand autopilot.

### Source

Anchored by `memory-bank/audits/2026-05-13-pricing-consistency-audit.md` (PR #631). The same audit landed Phase 4b across `constants/pricing.ts`, `lib/currency.ts`, `data/answers.ts`, `pages/Pricing.tsx`, the docs-site llms.txt feeds, and the SEO comparison data — this release ships the corresponding MCP-protocol-level fix.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- `MCP_VERSION` bumped to `1.7.6`.
- **`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` auto-derived from `TOOL_CATALOG`**: previously hardcoded to 16 tools; now reflects the live catalog (75 tools) so Smithery / marketplace discovery stays in sync with the source of truth.

### Internal

- Deduped the redundant `require('./lib/tool-catalog.js')` in the unauthenticated `tools/list` handler (single import per request).

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **`upload_media` base64 path**: new optional `file_data` + `file_name` params let Claude Desktop, Claude Web, and other remote agents upload bytes directly without a filesystem path. Content-type is validated against an allowlist, base64 charset is checked, and decoded size is capped at 10MB before the Edge Function call. `file_name` is `basename()`-sanitized.
- **`schedule_post` auto-rehost**: any `media_url` / `media_urls` / `job_id` result URL that is not already R2-signed is automatically persisted into R2 via `upload-to-r2` before posting. Keeps scheduled posts alive past ephemeral-URL expiry (Replicate, OpenAI, DALL-E, kie.ai) and feeds byte-upload platforms (X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Bluesky). New optional `auto_rehost` parameter (default: true) opts out.

### Security

- **SSRF guard on caller URLs**: every URL passed to auto-rehost is validated by `quickSSRFCheck` — rejects localhost, RFC1918 private ranges, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), embedded credentials, and non-HTTP(S) protocols.
- **Hono patched**: `hono` override bumped 4.12.12 → 4.12.14 to resolve GHSA-458j-xx4x-4375 (JSX attribute HTML injection, moderate).

### Changed

- Tool descriptions updated on `upload_media` (routing guide for path vs. base64 vs. URL) and `schedule_post.media_url` (explicit ephemeral-URL safety note).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **`/config` endpoint**: Returns server configuration (tools count, version, capabilities) without authentication
- **Rate limit exemptions**: `/config`, `/health`, and `/.well-known/` paths bypass rate limiting
- **All tools migrated to gateway**: 13 tool files moved from `getSupabaseClient()` to `callEdgeFunction('mcp-data', ...)` — tools now work in cloud mode (API key users)
- **REST API layer**: Universal tool proxy (`POST /v1/tools/:name`), 15 convenience endpoints, OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- **64 tools** (was 52): distribution, media, and configuration tools added
- **mcp-data gateway**: 17 new actions added for cloud-mode tool execution

### Fixed

- **Smithery OAuth**: `/register` now allows all HTTPS redirect URIs per MCP spec (was Claude-only)
- **Zod 4 compatibility**: Upgraded zod 3→4 for SDK v1.27 compatibility
- **Express middleware**: Added express-rate-limit + cors as direct dependencies

### Security

- 50kb body limit on all endpoints
- `sanitizeError` on /mcp catch path
- Email removed from auth chain
- Generation rate limit 20/min

### Internal

- 64 tools, 900+ tests, ~375KB build
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec auto-generated from tool schemas

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Tool discovery**: `sn tools` command lists all 52 MCP tools, filterable by `--module` and `--scope`
- **Introspection**: `sn info` shows version, tool count, auth status, and credit balance (works offline)
- **Content plan CLI**: `sn plan list|view|approve` wrappers for content plan management
- **Presets**: `sn preset list|show|save|delete` with 6 built-in platform presets (instagram-reel, tiktok, youtube-short, etc.)
- **Interactive REPL**: `socialneuron-mcp repl` with tab completion and persistent auth
- **Progressive disclosure**: New `search_tools` MCP tool reduces agent token usage from 55K to ~500 tokens
- **Unified JSON envelope**: All CLI JSON output includes `schema_version: "1"`, `ok`, `command`, typed errors with `errorType` + `retryable` + `hint`
- **`--json` everywhere**: `--version --json`, `--help --json` now return structured JSON

### Fixed

- Error handler (`withSnErrorHandling`) now wraps all dispatcher handler calls — consistent error formatting
- Flag validation runs before auth — missing flags show VALIDATION error, not AUTH error
- Deduplicated platform normalization in publish handler
- `schema_version: "1"` added to whoami, health, logout JSON output

### Internal

- 52 tools (was 51), 759 tests (was 698), 374.7KB build
- New files: tool-catalog.ts, discovery.ts (CLI + MCP), planning.ts, presets.ts, repl.ts
- CLI E2E test suite (23 tests), MCP E2E test suite (13 tests)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **README**: Removed phantom "MCP API $19/mo" plan — pricing now matches actual tiers (Trial/Starter/Pro/Team)
- **README**: Rewrote scopes section with tool-to-scope mapping
- **README**: Security section now shows trust signals instead of implementation internals
- **README**: Added telemetry section with opt-out instructions (`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`)
- **README**: Added MCP vs CLI distinction, npx usage note, fixed tool count to 51
- **Device auth**: Removed decorative PKCE from device code flow (code_challenge was sent but never verified on exchange)
- **Logout**: Message now honestly says "removed from this device" with link to server-side revocation
- **LICENSE**: Added trade name "(trading as Social Neuron)" to copyright holder
- **SECURITY.md**: Removed phantom 1.1.x from supported versions (never published to npm)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Added Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) section

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Hardcoded anon key fallback**: npm consumers no longer need to configure `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the public anon key is embedded as `CLOUD_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Gateway token system**: HMAC-SHA256 tokens prevent direct Edge Function bypass of mcp-gateway credit/scope enforcement
- **Standardized error responses**: All 17 mcp-gateway error paths now return structured `{ error, message, upgrade_url?, retry_after? }` JSON

### Security

- Tightened `api_keys` RLS policies from `{public}` to `{authenticated}` role
- Added `key_hash` index on `api_keys` table
- Daily credit reset cron job (`reset-api-key-daily-credits`)
- 11 downstream Edge Functions now verify gateway tokens on service-role calls

### Fixed

- `.npmignore` now excludes `*.spec.ts`, `.tmp*`, `.tmp-scripts/`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **New CLI commands**: `sn autopilot`, `sn usage`, `sn loop`, `sn credits` for deterministic access to management tools
- **Modular CLI architecture**: Extracted `sn` subcommand logic into `src/cli/sn.ts` for better maintainability

### Changed

- Refactored `src/index.ts` to reduce file size and improve readability

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **50+ MCP tools** across 19 modules: ideation, content, distribution, analytics, brand, screenshot, remotion, insights, youtube-analytics, comments, planning, quality, credits, autopilot, loop-summary, usage, and more
- **OAuth 2.1 authentication** with PKCE browser flow, device code flow, and API key paste
- **Scope-based access control**: `mcp:full`, `mcp:read`, `mcp:write`, `mcp:distribute`, `mcp:analytics`, `mcp:comments`
- **Cloud mode** via MCP gateway proxy (recommended) — service-role key stays server-side
- **Secure credential storage**: macOS Keychain, Linux secret-tool, file fallback
- **Auto-configuration** for Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- **CLI tools**: `sn publish`, `sn preflight`, `sn quality-check`, `sn status`, `sn posts`, `sn refresh-analytics`
- **Loop summary tool** for closed-loop content optimization feedback
- **Credit balance and budget tracking** tools
- **658 unit tests** across 32 test files

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Default scope for JWT users without explicit scopes changed from `mcp:full` to `mcp:read`. Users who relied on implicit full access must now request `mcp:full` explicitly when generating API keys or authenticating via device code. This follows the principle of least privilege — read-only by default, write access on request.

### Security

- JWT scope default changed from `mcp:full` to `mcp:read` (principle of least privilege)
- API key expiry validation (reject expired keys)
- Session ownership verification (prevent cross-user session hijack)
- Health endpoint split: public `/health` (minimal) vs authenticated `/health/details`
- Per-user rate limiting in HTTP mode (token bucket)
- Per-request budget isolation in HTTP mode (AsyncLocalStorage)
- Daily credit cap enforcement in gateway
- Pre-execution balance check for expensive operations (video/image generation)
- Gateway-side userId override (prevents horizontal privilege escalation)
- Per-user rate limiting (100 req/min default)
- Per-tool rate limits for expensive operations
- Agent loop detection (>5 identical calls in 30s)
- Session hard cap (200 calls/hour)
- Shell metacharacter injection detection
- Audit logging with PII-redacted params
- Kill switch for emergency halt of autonomous operations
- Subscription tier-based scope restrictions
- SSRF protection on media URL parameters
